# This default profile is used when running a single instance completely standalone:
spring:
  profiles: default
server:
  port: 17001  
eureka:
  environment: dev
  instance:
    hostname: eurekahost 
  client:
    registerWithEureka: false
    fetchRegistry: false
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://${eureka.instance.hostname}:${server.port}/eureka/    

# primary, secondary illustrate running 2 intercommunicating instances.  This example has them running
# side-by-side on localhost -- which is unrealistic in production -- but does illustrate how multiple instances collaborate.
